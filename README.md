## Details of Project 

I made an attempt to deploy with Heroku, however, it caused my program to crash so I recorded a video 
here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TleIKgnAtAQFUODc_B0E8bhIAdFzsA8f/view?usp=sharing 

If you would like to run the program on your own: 
1. Download Spring Boot Tools from: https://spring.io/tools
2. Open SpringBoot Tools (its layout is very similar to Eclipse!)
3. File -> import -> git -> project from git (with smart tools)
4. Copy the HTTP link from GitHub and paste it into the URI input field
5. Click next until the prompt box disappears
6. Left-Click on the project in the file tree -> run as spring boot application
7. Open port 8080 -> http://localhost:8080/ and project should show up
